# HOW TO USE
This second assignment simulates almost a pokemon game thanks to the State Machine logic.
To start playing:

```python3 main.py```

Once in the terminal, all inputs must be written "as written" in the terminal (i.e. you want to change pokemon, then you have to write "Change Pokemon" as it is written).
